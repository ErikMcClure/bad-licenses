THIS SOFTWARE MUST NOT BE USED TO PROMOTE ANY CHARACTERS FROM THE ANIME GABRIEL DROPOUT IN ANY WAY EXCEPT SATANIA. Characters from other shows are fine, but the ones from Gabriel Dropout are not, these include, but aren't limited to: Gabriel, Vignette, Raphiel, Tapris, Iinchou, Haniel, Martiel, Master, Tanaka, Ueno, Zelel, or any other character that could be revealed in the future.

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE TO ANTI-PROMOTE SATANIA, is that a word? I couldn't think of anything, but... you know... anti-promotion is like the reverse of promotion, like, when you anti-promote something you're trying to get people to hate it, or just like it less, so if you used this website to say, for instance, that Satania is a bad waifu, it would be a violation of this license.
