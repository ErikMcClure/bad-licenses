NUCLEAR WASTE SOFTWARE LICENSE V1.0

This software license is a message... and part of a system of messages...
pay attention to it! Writing this software and associated documentation
files (the "Software") was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a
powerful culture. This Software is not a place of honor... no highly
esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here. What is here was
dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger. The
danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the
center of danger is here... of a particular size and syntax. The danger is
still present, in your time, as it was in ours. The danger is to the mind, and
it can kill. The form of the danger is an emanation of incoherence. The danger
is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this software digitally or
intellectually.
