As of Janaury 15th, 2023, Mojavesoft presents these rules to anyone who's copy was obtained with this license:

1. No code leaking. This means that you agree to not publicly share anything based off of anyone's source code leak of SUIT. Code leaks are defined in this context as either due to an offical release of the code by mistake, or by manually decompiling the files provided.

2. No recompilation for the sole purpose of compatitability with non-Microsoft operating systems. You can still distribute it with emulators, just don't recompile it for non-Microsoft operating systems.

3. No removing this license when redistributing. This means that if you are going to give this program to someone else, ensure that an exact copy of this agreement is provided too.

4. All users are bound by these rules as soon as they either read the license, or, alternatively, as soon as one of your computational digital devices attemps to download this software.

5. If you want, you can request for PPPDUD to sign a waiver to allow for one person of your choice to have the right to bypass these rules as long as I know the person in real life and can trust them.  However, as soon as it is signed, the person agrees that PPPDUD can revoke the waiver at any time, forcing the person to go by this license until I sign a waiver for them again. Please include Rule 5 in your waiver request thingy.

6. Mojavesoft can determine what constitues as a violation to this agreement.

7. After violating this agreement, we may choose to do any number of legal things to you at any given time.
