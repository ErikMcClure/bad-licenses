# Ethical Open License 1.0

## Preamble
This License promotes the open sharing of software while safeguarding against unethical exploitation, including unauthorized use in training artificial intelligence models and harmful commercial practices. By using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to these terms.

The Ethical Open License is designed to ensure that software remains free and open while preventing its use in ways that harm individuals, communities, or the environment. It builds on the principles of existing open-source licenses but adds specific provisions to address modern challenges, such as AI training and ethical misuse.
