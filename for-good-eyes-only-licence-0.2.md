# Preamble

Conscious of his/her responsibility before God and humankind, impelled by the
will to serve the peace of the world, the Licensor, by virtue of his/her authorship
rights, has placed his/her work under this For Good Eyes Only Licence.<sup>2</sup>

The human dignity shall be inviolable. Respecting it is the obligation of all
power of the Licensee and the Licensor.<sup>3</sup>

The Licensee and the Licensor thus profess inviolable and inalienable human
rights as the foundation of every human community, of peace and of justice in
the world.<sup>4</sup>


# Purpose

This Licence’s purpose is promoting and supporting a sustainable and dignified
world by attaching conditions of justice and morality to the use and re-
distribution of the Licensed Work.


# Interpretation

This Licence shall be interpreted on a common-sense basis and as a coherent,
non-absurd and non-contradictory flow of ideas, thoughts and moral points of
view. Definitional gaps shall not be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with the
intent and the essence of this Licence. The laws, legal norms, conventions,
treaties or court rulings quoted or referred to are to be regarded as an aid to
interpretation. This Licence shall be interpreted in British Standard English.


# Scope

The terms of this Licence only apply where any copyright would be infringed in
the hypothetical absence of this Licence. To this Licence the law<sup>5</sup> of the
Licensee’s jurisdiction, from which the Permission was granted, shall apply. The
rights granted to the Licensee under the terms of this Licence only apply to the
specific version of the Licensed Work that is licensed under this exact Licence,
and not to any past, future or other versions of the Licensed Work.


# Acceptance

This Licence is automatically offered to every person and entity subject to its
terms and conditions. The Licensee accepts this Licence and agrees to its terms
and conditions by taking any action with the Licensed Work that, absent this
Licence, would infringe any intellectual property right held by the Licensor.<sup>6</sup>


# Permission

The Licensor grants by this License to the Licensee, free of charge, permission to
do anything with the Licensed Work, to the extent of the Licensor’s rights under
applicable copyright and patent law, that would otherwise infringe

  1. the Licensor’s copyright in the Licensed Work or

  2. any patent claims in the Licensed Work that the Licensor may license or will license,

subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Licence.<sup>6</sup>


# Irrevocability

The rights granted once to the Licensee under this Licence remain unaffected by
any future changes to the Licence as long as the Licensee fully complies with the
terms of this Licence.


# Change of licence

The Licensor may modify the licence of past, current and future versions of the
Licensed Work at any time. In the event of a licence amendment to past versions
or the current version of the Licensed Work, only the new licence adopted by the
amendment will apply with respect to those persons or other legal entities who
commence use of the Licensed Work subsequent to the effective date of the
amendment. They may not invoke the replaced licence.


# Defectiveness

The Licensee is urged to examine the Licensed Work for any defect prior to any
interaction with it. The Licensee’s guilelessness shall not be to the Licensor’s
detriment.

  2. to protect the digital security and privacy of his/her software
     adaptation’s users to the best of his/her knowledge and belief and as far
     as feasible and

     stating the author’s name or pseudonym as well as a licence notice<sup>8</sup>

     which the Licensed Work has been taken.


# Licensee’s Prohibitions

   1. to commercialise or patent his/her adaptation of the Licensed Work in
      any way if it is not part of an extensive product of him/her or

      under a separate licence where he/she is not the principal author.

           recognised state<sup>11</sup> or

permanently destroy all of his/her copies and adaptations, whether public or
non-public, of the Licensed Work and to immediately stop all interaction with
the Licensed Work forever. A Permanent Termination may not be lifted by any
other provision of this Licence.


# Temporary Suspension

The Permission granted under this Licence shall be temporarily suspended as
soon as the Licensee is guilty of

  1. intentionally, as well as (a) illegally, (b) illegitimately or (c) without
     weighty, justifying reason, possessing or handling weapons intended
     or suitable for warfare,

  2. intentionally undermining the privacy or digital security of the users of

     available to the general public,

  4. intentionally and directly intruding or exploiting any other person’s

     General Data Protection Regulation<sup>5</sup> of the European Union, even if the
     GDPR would not normally apply in the Licensee’s jurisdiction,

  5. intentionally using any trackers in his/her adaptation of the Licensed
     Work without the user’s explicit and free permission,

  6. intentionally perpetrating large-scale or organised fraud<sup>20</sup> or

  7. intentionally and illegitimately excluding anyone from using the
     (Licensee’s) adaptation of the Licensed Work,

commencing with the Licensee’s initial availment of the Permission. Once the
Licensee has

  1. ceased committing any acts sanctioned under this section,

  2. remedied any potential damage caused,

  3. if required by applicable law, has reported the matter to the authority
     in charge and,

  4. if it concerns them, has informed the users of his/her adaptation about
     the incident in a transparent and detailed manner,

the Permission initially granted shall regain effect.<sup>21</sup> As long as the Permission is
suspended, the Licensee may not publicly distribute his/her adaptation.


# Exclusion

Excluded from the Permission of this Licence are

  1. any persons and any other legal entities which have ever been guilty of
     any inexcusable offences,

  2. any illegitimate regimes, including their leadership, government,
     legislature, judiciary, authorities and any other state bodies, and

  3. any illegitimate organisations, including their management, officials,
     representatives, members, employees and any other persons directly
     associated with the respective organisation.


# Guilt

Acting on orders or instructions or on behalf of others does not exculpate the
commission of any acts sanctioned under the “Permanent Termination” or
“Temporary Suspension” section.

Whoever intentionally incites, instigates or assists in the perpetration of any act
sanctioned under the “Permanent Termination” section shall be deemed
equivalent to a perpetrator of any such act.

A commander or superior who intentionally or grossly negligently neglects to
prevent his subordinate from committing any offence sanctioned under the
“Permanent Termination” section shall be deemed equivalent to a perpetrator
of the offence committed by the subordinate.

A person who commits any offence under the “Permanent Termination” or
“Temporary Suspension” section in execution of an order or instruction acts
without guilt, provided that he/she does not realise that the order or instruction
is inadmissible and that its inadmissibility is also not obvious.

If the perpetrator lacks the insight to do wrong at the time of committing the
offence, he/she acts without guilt, provided that he/she could not have avoided
this mistake.<sup>22</sup>


# Intention

A perpetrator acts intentionally

  1. if he/she is aware that the act is sanctioned or could have anticipated
     this with reasonable effort of mind and

  2. if he/she, by his/her own free choice<sup>23</sup>, purposefully pursues or,
     possibly as a lesser evil, at least acquiesces in or recklessly accepts
     his/her commission of the act.

There is no intent

  1. in an offence if, at the time of committal, the perpetrator had no
     knowledge of a circumstance that is part of the elements of the
     offence<sup>24</sup> or

  2. in displaying symbols of illegitimate organisations or disseminating
     state media content or propaganda media, if that serves a legitimate
     purpose, in particular education and enlightenment, science and
     research, journalism, encyclopaedic purposes, art, satire or criticism of
     the subject.


# Violation

Any failure of the Licensee to act according to the terms and conditions of this
Licence is both a breach of the Licence and an infringement of the intellectual
property rights of the Licensor<sup>6</sup> and results in the immediate termination of this
Licence between the Licensor and the Licensee, including all rights granted by
the Licence.

For Licence breaches of the “Licensee’s Obligations” and “Licensee’s
Prohibitions” sections, the Licence – including all rights granted – shall only be
temporarily suspended until such time as the Licensee fully rectifies his/her
misconduct.

In the event of a substantial breach of the Licence within the meaning of the
“Permanent Termination” section, the Licensee is obliged to make a punitive
donation to one or more non-profit organisations or other charitable
associations of his/her choice, which are officially recognised as such, are not
illegitimate organisations and are primarily dedicated to

  1. the prosecution or reappraisal of human rights violations or

  2. the promotion of fundamental rights; democracy; the Free Democratic
     Basic Order; data protection; privacy; IT security; Free, open-source or
     Ethical Software; health care; education; scientific research;
     environmental protection or investigative journalism.

The punitive donation shall amount to a total of 4%

  1. of his/her total annual income or total assets (depending on which is
     higher), if the Licensee is an individual and (a) his/her total annual
     income<sup>25</sup> has a value of at least €500,000 or (b) he/she has total assets
     worth €1 million or more<sup>25</sup>,

  2. of its total annual turnover, if the Licensee is a company or other for-profit business organisation and the total monthly turnover<sup>25</sup> has a
     value of at least €1 million, or

  3. of its calculated monthly financial resources (based on its total
     resources<sup>25</sup>), if the Licensee is a state authority or other state body.

In any other case, no punitive donation is required.


# No Liability or Warranty

To the full extent allowed by law, the Licensed Work comes “as is”, without any
warranty, express or implied, and the Licensor and any other contributor to the
Licensed Work shall not be liable to anyone for any damages or other liability
arising from, out of or in connection with the Licensed Work or this Licence,
under any kind of legal claim;<sup>26</sup> at least in the absence of gross negligence and
intent to the detriment of the Licensee.


# Indemnity

The Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify the Licensor (and any other
contributor to the Licensed Work) against all losses, damages, liabilities,
deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties,
fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including the Licensor’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to the Licensee’s use of the Software;<sup>6</sup> at
least in the absence of gross negligence and intent to the detriment of the
Licensee.


# Severability

Should any individual provisions of this Licence be deemed invalid or unfeasible
or should the Licence be found to be incomplete, the validity and feasibility of the
remaining provisions of the Licence and the Licensor’s copyright shall remain
unaffected thereby. The ineffective or missing provisions shall be replaced by
those effective provisions whose effects come closest to the Licensor’s intention
and the essence of this Licence.


# Definitions

## Copyright

The term “Copyright” (or simply “rights”) refers to any legal rights a creator of
literary, scientific, artistic, software or other works holds to the respective
Licensed Work, including patenting rights. These legal rights include at least
those according to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works<sup>5</sup>.


## Licensor

The Licensor is the party that has placed the Licensed Work under this Licence by
virtue of its copyright.


## Licensee

The Licensee is any person or entity receiving a copy of the Licensed Work.<sup>26</sup>


## Commercialisation

Commercialisation is the direct generation of profit from part or all of the
Licensed Work or an adaptation thereof, for example by selling or renting the
Licensed Work, an adaptation or its licence.

Exempt from this is the collection of donations for charitable or non-profit
purposes or of small amounts as well as reasonable user fees to cover (in
particular recurring) costs<sup>27</sup> incurred by the operation of the Licensed Work (or
an adaptation) as a service to the general public.


## Adaptation

An adaptation is a partial or complete version of the Licensed Work that is
created or re-distributed by the Licensee, possibly also in a modified form.


## Extensive product

An extensive product is a collection or combination of at least two individual
works that consists predominantly of components other than adaptations of the
Licensed Work. The adaptation of the Licensed Work is an addition to the
extensive product and is not the main or core function of the extensive work, but
at most one of several components.


## Support

Support includes the paid or unpaid work for, providing any services to, trading
in, financing, supplying any products or goods<sup>28</sup> to, publicly protesting for,
publicly promoting or publicly advocating for an entity, or any other action the
purpose of which is to further the supported entity.


## Fundamental rights

Fundamental rights include at least those rights explicitly or implicitly set forth in

  1. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations,<sup>5</sup>
  2. the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<sup>5</sup>
  3. the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,<sup>5</sup>
  4. the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union<sup>5</sup> or
  5. the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples<sup>5</sup>.

Ostracised weapons and methods of warfare include at least those subject to

  1. the Hague Conventions,<sup>5</sup>

  2. the Geneva Protocol,<sup>5</sup>

  7. the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
     and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction<sup>5</sup> or

  8. any other comparable international conventions<sup>5</sup> that prohibit those
     weapons or methods of warfare that are cruel or cause unnecessary
     suffering.


## Free Democratic Basic Order

The Free Democratic Basic Order is an order which, to the exclusion of any rule of
force and arbitrariness, constitutes a rule of law based on the self-determination
of the people according to the will of the respective majority and on freedom and
equality. The fundamental principles of this order include at least:

Respect for human rights, especially the right of the personality to life and free
development, the sovereignty of the people, the separation of powers, the
accountability of the government, the legality of the administration, the
independence of the courts, the multi-party principle and equal opportunities for
all political parties with the right to form and exercise an opposition in
accordance with the constitution.<sup>29</sup>


## Illegitimate regime

A state, its state party, its state party’s youth organisations, government,
legislature, executive, judiciary, administration, police, military or intelligence
services, or any of its agencies, organisations or other state authorities shall be
deemed to be an illegitimate regime

  1. if the state does not maintain a Free Democratic Basic Order,

  2. if the state or one of the aforementioned bodies systematically prevents
     any persons from exercising their fundamental rights,

  3. if the state or any of the aforementioned bodies systematically
     commits any inexcusable offences,

  4. if the state is listed as authoritarian in the Economist Intelligence
     Unit’s “Democracy Index”<sup>30,31</sup>,

  5. if the state is listed as not free in Freedom House’s “Freedom in the
     World” report<sup>30,32</sup> or

  6. if the state’s score in the Reporters Without Borders “Press Freedom
     Index” is worse than 40 (based on the 2022 scale)<sup>30,33</sup>.

Decisive for the assessment of whether a state is an illegitimate regime is not the
theoretical, legal situation on paper, but the actual circumstances in real practice.


## State surveillance

State surveillance includes the collection, accumulation, storage, processing,
analysis or transfer of personal data or any other – at least pseudonymously –
identifying information by any state bodies, in particular law enforcement
authorities and intelligence services, or on their behalf by organisations,
companies, persons or any other entities, provided that there is no sufficient
initial suspicion of a criminal offence having been committed by the person
concerned or that the surveillance is unlawful, unjustified or disproportionate in
its invasiveness.


## Trackers

Trackers are software<sup>34</sup> designed to

  1. collect information about a user or mark him/her in such a way that
     he/she can be almost reliably recognised at a later point in time or
     across different websites or (digital) services or to

  2. derive identifying data points about a user’s personal preferences,
     behaviour or other personal characteristics,

without this being immediately imperative and thus justified by the absolute
core function of the overall software.


## Deforestation

Deforestation is defined as the clearing, burning or destruction of 0.5 or more
hectares of trees, that were either planted more than 50 years ago or were not
planted by humans or human-made equipment, within a one-year period.<sup>6</sup>

hydrosphere and atmosphere, as well as outer space.<sup>14</sup>


## Ecocide

Ecocide means unlawful or wanton35 acts committed with the knowledge that
there is a substantial likelihood of severe and widespread<sup>36</sup>, long-term or
irreversible damage, or damage not redressable within a reasonable period of
time, to the environment being caused by those acts.<sup>14</sup>


## Incitement of hatred

Whoever, in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace,

  1. incites hatred, violence or arbitrary action against a national, racial,
     religious or ethnic group, against parts of the population or against an
     individual on account of his/her membership of one of the
     aforementioned groups or parts of the population,

  2. attacks the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously
     disparaging or defaming one of the aforementioned groups, parts of the
     population or an individual on account of his/her membership of one of
     the aforementioned groups or parts of the population,

  3. approves, glorifies or justifies the National Socialist rule of violence
     and arbitrariness,

  4. approves, denies or trivialises a crime committed under the rule of
     National Socialism or

  5. disseminates or makes available to the public any content that is
     subject to any of the preceding points,

is guilty of incitement of hatred.<sup>37</sup>


## Illegitimate organisations

Companies, parties or any other organisations are to be deemed illegitimate,

  1. which oppose the Free Democratic Basic Order of any internationally
     generally recognised state<sup>11</sup>,

  2. which oppose the principles of the rule of law, democracy, personal
     liberty or international goodwill,

  3. which systematically commit any inexcusable offences,

  4. whose primary aims include any inexcusable offences or

  5. which have been declared unconstitutional<sup>5</sup> by the Federal
     Constitutional Court of the Federal Republic of Germany.


## Illegitimate exclusion

The exclusion of a person is illegitimate if it is based on a privacy decision<sup>38</sup> in
the meaning of the GDPR<sup>5</sup> or if it is done in an unjust manner, in particular based
on characteristics such as gender, “race”, ethnicity, colour of skin, eyes or hair,
phenotype, genotype, age, nationality, ancestry, origin, religion, social status,
illness or disability.
