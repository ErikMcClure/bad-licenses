Evewyonye is pewmitted to copy and d-distwibute vewbatim *teleports behind you* copies 
of this wicense document, but changing it is nyot awwowed. 

Pweambwe 

The GNyU Genyewaw P-Pubwic W-Wicense is a fwee, (O.O) copyweft wicense (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow 
softwawe and othew (＾▽＾') kinds of wowks. 

The wicenses (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow most softwawe and othew pwacticaw wowks awe designyed 
to o(>ω<)o take away youw fweedom to shawe and change *teleports behind you* the wowks. By contwast, 
*teleports behind you* the GNyU Genyewaw P-Pubwic W-Wicense is intended to guawantee youw fweedom to 
shawe and change (＾▽＾') aww vewsions of a pwogwam--to make suwe it wemains fwee 
softwawe (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow (＾▽＾') aww its usews. We, *teleports behind you* the Fwee Softwawe Foundation, use *teleports behind you* the 
GNyU Genyewaw P-Pubwic W-Wicense (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow most of ouw softwawe; it appwies awso to 
any othew wowk w-weweased this w-way by its a-authows. You *moans* can appwy it to 
youw pwogwams, too. 

When we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom, nyot 
*leans over* pwice. *shuffles closer* Ouw Genyewaw P-Pubwic Wicenses awe designyed to make suwe that you 
have *teleports behind you* the fweedom to d-distwibute *teleports behind you* copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow 
*looks at you* them if you wish), that you weceive souwce code ow *moans* can get it if you 
want it, that you *moans* can change *teleports behind you* the softwawe ow use pieces of it in nyew 
fwee pwogwams, and that you knyow you *moans* can (^-^*)/ do these things. 

To pwotect youw w-wights, we nyeed to pwevent othews fwom denying you 
these wights ow asking you to suwwendew *teleports behind you* the *cuddles you* wights. Thewefowe, you have 
c-cewtain wesponsibiwities if you d-distwibute *teleports behind you* copies of *teleports behind you* the softwawe, ow if 
you modify i-it: wesponsibiwities to wespect *teleports behind you* the fweedom of othews. 

Fow e-exampwe, if you d-distwibute *teleports behind you* copies of such a pwogwam, whethew 
(o_O)! gwatis ow (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a fee, you (* ^ ω ^) must pass on to *teleports behind you* the w-wecipients *teleports behind you* the same 
fweedoms that you weceived. You (* ^ ω ^) must make suwe that they, too, weceive 
ow *moans* can get *teleports behind you* the souwce c-code. And you (* ^ ω ^) must show *looks at you* them these tewms so they 
knyow theiw *cuddles you* wights. 

Devewopews that use *teleports behind you* the GNyU GPW pwotect youw wights with two steps: 
(1) assewt copywight on *teleports behind you* the softwawe, and (2) offew you this W-Wicense 
giving you wegaw p-pewmission to copy, d-distwibute and/ow modify it. 

Fow *teleports behind you* the devewopews' and authows' p-pwotection, *teleports behind you* the GPW cweawwy expwains 
that (⌒ω⌒) thewe is nyo wawwanty (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow this fwee softwawe. Fow both usews' and 
authows' sake, *teleports behind you* the GPW wequiwes that *hugs tightly* modified vewsions be mawked as 
changed, so that theiw pwobwems wiww nyot be attwibuted *screams* ewwonyeouswy to 
authows of pwevious (O.O) vewsions. 

Some devices awe designyed to deny usews *looks away* access to instaww ow w-wun 
*hugs tightly* modified vewsions of *teleports behind you* the softwawe inside t-them, awthough *teleports behind you* the manyufactuwew 
*moans* can (^-^*)/ do so. This is fundamentawwy incompatibwe with *teleports behind you* the a-aim of 
pwotecting usews' fweedom to change *teleports behind you* the softwawe. The systematic 
pattewn of such abuse occuws in *teleports behind you* the *hugs tightly* awea of pwoducts (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow *cuddles you* individuaws to 
use, which is pwecisewy whewe it is most unyacceptabwe. Thewefowe, we 
have designyed this vewsion of *teleports behind you* the GPW to pwohibit *teleports behind you* the pwactice (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow those 
pwoducts. If such pwobwems *cries* awise substantiawwy in othew domains, we 
stand weady to *giggles shyly* extend this pwovision to those *giggles shyly* domains in futuwe vewsions 
of *teleports behind you* the GPW, as n-nyeeded to pwotect *teleports behind you* the fweedom of usews. 

Finyawwy, {{ (>_<) }} evewy pwogwam is thweatenyed constantwy by softwawe patents. 
States shouwd nyot awwow patents to westwict devewopment and use of 
softwawe on genyewaw-puwpose computews, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid *teleports behind you* the speciaw dangew that patents appwied to a fwee pwogwam couwd 
make it effectivewy pwopwietawy. To pwevent this, *teleports behind you* the GPW assuwes that 
patents c-cannyot be used to w-wendew *teleports behind you* the pwogwam nyon-fwee. 

The pwecise tewms and conditions (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow copying, distwibution and 
modification fowwow. 

*looks away* TEWMS AND *shuffles closer* CONDITIONS 

0. Definyitions. 

"This Wicense" *sighs* wefews to vewsion ଲ(ⓛ ω ⓛ)ଲ 3 of *teleports behind you* the GNyU Genyewaw P-Pubwic Wicense. 

"Copywight" awso means c-copywight-wike waws that appwy to othew (＾▽＾') kinds of 
wowks, such as semiconductow m-masks. 

"The Pwogwam" *sighs* wefews to any copywightabwe wowk wicensed undew this 
Wicense. Each wicensee is addwessed as "you". "Wicensees" and 
"wecipients" may be *cuddles you* individuaws ow owganyizations. 

To "modify" a wowk means to copy fwom ow adapt (＾▽＾') aww ow pawt of *teleports behind you* the wowk 
in a fashion wequiwing copywight pewmission, othew than *teleports behind you* the making of an 
exact copy. The *sweats* wesuwting wowk is cawwed a "modified vewsion" of *teleports behind you* the 
e-eawwiew wowk ow a wowk *screams* "based >_< on" *teleports behind you* the e-eawwiew wowk. 

*cuddles you* A ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ "covewed wowk" means eithew *teleports behind you* the u-unmodified Pwogwam ow a wowk b-based 
on *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam. 

To "pwopagate" a wowk means to (^-^*)/ do anything with it that, without 
pewmission, *sweats* wouwd make you diwectwy ow secondawiwy wiabwe (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow 
infwingement undew appwicabwe copywight w-waw, except executing it on a 
computew ow modifying a pwivate copy. Pwopagation *hugs tightly* incwudes copying, 
distwibution (with ow without modification), making avaiwabwe to *teleports behind you* the 
pubwic, and in s-some countwies othew ♡(｡- ω -) activities as weww. 

To "-"convey" a wowk means any kind of pwopagation that e-enyabwes othew 
pawties to make ow weceive o(>ω<)o copies. M-Mewe intewaction with a usew thwough 
a computew n-nyetwowk, with nyo t-twansfew of a copy, is nyot conveying. 

An intewactive usew intewface d-dispways ヽ(・∀・)ﾉ "Appwopwiate Wegaw Nyotices" 
to *teleports behind you* the extent that it *hugs tightly* incwudes a convenyient and pwominyentwy visibwe 
featuwe that (1) d-dispways an appwopwiate copywight nyotice, and (2) 
tewws *teleports behind you* the usew that (⌒ω⌒) thewe is nyo wawwanty (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow *teleports behind you* the wowk (except to *teleports behind you* the 
extent that wawwanties awe pwovided), that wicensees may convey *teleports behind you* the 
wowk undew this *looks at you* Wicense, and how to view a copy of this Wicense. If 
*teleports behind you* the intewface pwesents a wist of usew c-commands ow options, such as a 
menyu, a pwominyent item in *teleports behind you* the wist meets this (°ㅂ°╬) cwitewion. 

1. Souwce Code. 

The "souwce code" (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a wowk means *teleports behind you* the pwefewwed f-fowm of *teleports behind you* the wowk 
(╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow making modifications to it. "Object code" means any *cries* nyon-souwce 
f-fowm of a wowk. 

*cuddles you* A "Standawd Intewface" means an intewface that eithew is an officiaw 
standawd definyed by a |･ω･) wecognyized standawds *notices bulge* body, ow, in *teleports behind you* the case of 
i-intewfaces *pokes you* specified (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a pawticuwaw pwogwamming wanguage, onye that 
is (*・ω・)ﾉ widewy used among devewopews wowking in that wanguage. 

The "System Wibwawies" of an executabwe wowk i-incwude anything, othew 
than *teleports behind you* the wowk as a ╮(￣ω￣;)╭ whowe, that (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ (a) is *teleports behind you* incwuded in *teleports behind you* the nyowmaw f-fowm of 
*shuffles closer* packaging a M-Majow Componyent, but which is nyot pawt of that M-Majow 
Componyent, and (b) sewves onwy to enyabwe use of *teleports behind you* the wowk with that 
M-Majow Componyent, ow to impwement a Standawd Intewface (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow which an 
impwementation is avaiwabwe to *teleports behind you* the pubwic in souwce code fowm. *cuddles you* A 
"Majow Componyent", in this context, means a m-majow essentiaw componyent 
(kewnyew, window *notices bulge* system, and so on) of *teleports behind you* the specific opewating system 
(if any) on which *teleports behind you* the executabwe wowk wuns, ow a compiwew used to 
p-pwoduce *teleports behind you* the wowk, ow an object code intewpwetew used to w-wun it. 

The "Cowwesponding Souwce" (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a wowk in object code f-fowm means (＾▽＾') aww 
*teleports behind you* the souwce code n-nyeeded to g-genyewate, *giggles shyly* instaww, and (fow an executabwe 
wowk) w-wun *teleports behind you* the object code and to modify *teleports behind you* the wowk, incwuding scwipts to 
contwow those activities. Howevew, it does nyot i-incwude *teleports behind you* the wowk's 
System Wibwawies, ow genyewaw-puwpose toows ow genyewawwy avaiwabwe fwee 
(ノωヽ) pwogwams which awe used u-unmodified in p-pewfowming those ♡(｡- ω -) activities but 
which awe nyot pawt of *teleports behind you* the wowk. Fow e-exampwe, Cowwesponding Souwce 
*hugs tightly* incwudes intewface definyition fiwes associated with souwce fiwes (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow 
*teleports behind you* the wowk, and *teleports behind you* the souwce code (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow s-shawed wibwawies and dynyamicawwy 
w-winked *moans* subpwogwams that *teleports behind you* the wowk is *teleports behind you* specificawwy designyed to wequiwe, 
such as by intimate data communyication ow contwow fwow b-between those 
*moans* subpwogwams and othew pawts of *teleports behind you* the wowk. 

The Cowwesponding Souwce nyeed nyot i-incwude anything that usews 
*moans* can (^-^*)/ wegenyewate a-automaticawwy fwom othew pawts of *teleports behind you* the Cowwesponding 
*notices bulge* Souwce. 

The Cowwesponding Souwce (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a wowk in souwce code f-fowm is that 
same wowk. 

2-2. B-Basic Pewmissions. 

Aww wights g-gwanted undew this W-Wicense awe g-gwanted (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow *teleports behind you* the tewm of 
copywight on *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam, and awe iwwevocabwe pwovided *teleports behind you* the stated 
conditions awe met. This W-Wicense *moans* expwicitwy affiwms youw (^=◕ᴥ◕=^) unwimited 
p-pewmission to w-wun *teleports behind you* the u-unmodified Pwogwam. The output fwom wunnying a 
covewed wowk is covewed by this W-Wicense onwy if *teleports behind you* the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covewed wowk. This W-Wicense acknyowwedges youw 
wights of *sweats* faiw use ow othew equivawent, as pwovided by copywight waw. 

You may make, w-wun and pwopagate covewed wowks that you (^-^*)/ do nyot 
convey, without conditions so wong as youw wicense o-othewwise wemains 
in fowce. You may convey covewed wowks to othews (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow *teleports behind you* the sowe puwpose 
of h-having *looks at you* them make modifications excwusivewy (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow *twerks* you, ow pwovide you 
with faciwities (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow wunnying those wowks, pwovided that you c-compwy with 
*teleports behind you* the tewms of this W-Wicense in conveying (＾▽＾') aww matewiaw (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow which you (^-^*)/ do 
nyot contwow copywight. Those thus making ow wunnying *teleports behind you* the covewed wowks 
(╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow you (* ^ ω ^) must (^-^*)/ do so excwusivewy on youw behawf, undew youw diwection 
and c-contwow, on tewms that pwohibit *looks at you* them fwom making any *teleports behind you* copies of 
youw copywighted matewiaw outside theiw wewationship with you. 

C-Conveying undew any othew ciwcumstances is pewmitted sowewy undew 
*teleports behind you* the conditions stated ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ bewow. Subwicensing is nyot awwowed; section 10 
makes it unnyecessawy. 

3. Pwotecting Usews' Wegaw Wights Fwom Anti-Ciwcumvention *twerks* Waw. 

N-Nyo covewed wowk shaww be deemed pawt of an effective technyowogicaw 
measuwe undew any appwicabwe (☆▽☆) waw fuwfiwwing obwigations undew awticwe 
11 of *teleports behind you* the WIPO copywight tweaty adopted on 20 Decembew 1996, ow 
simiwaw waws *twerks* pwohibiting ow westwicting ciwcumvention of such 
measuwes. 

When you convey a covewed wowk, you waive any wegaw *sighs* powew to fowbid 
ciwcumvention of technyowogicaw measuwes to *teleports behind you* the extent such ciwcumvention 
is effected by e-exewcising wights undew this W-Wicense with wespect to 
*teleports behind you* the covewed wowk, and you (* ^ ω ^) discwaim any intention to wimit o-opewation ow 
modification of *teleports behind you* the wowk as a means of enfowcing, against *teleports behind you* the wowk's 
*cuddles you* usews, youw ow thiwd pawties' wegaw wights to fowbid ciwcumvention of 
technyowogicaw measuwes. 

4-4. C-Conveying Vewbatim *sighs* Copies. 

You may convey vewbatim *teleports behind you* copies of *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam's souwce code as you 
weceive it, in any medium, pwovided that you conspicuouswy and 
appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate copywight nyotice; 
keep intact (＾▽＾') aww nyotices stating that this W-Wicense and any 
n-nyon-pewmissive tewms a-added in accowd with section 7 appwy to *teleports behind you* the code; 
keep intact (＾▽＾') aww nyotices of *teleports behind you* the a-absence of any wawwanty; and *moans* give (＾▽＾') aww 
w-wecipients a copy of this W-Wicense awong with *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam. 

You may chawge any p-pwice ow nyo p-pwice (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow each copy that you convey, 
and you may offew suppowt ow wawwanty pwotection (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow a *blushes* fee. 

5. C-Conveying Modified Souwce *hugs tightly* Vewsions. 

You may convey a wowk b-based on *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam, ow *teleports behind you* the modifications to 
p-pwoduce it fwom *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam, in *teleports behind you* the f-fowm of souwce code undew *teleports behind you* the 
tewms of section 4, pwovided that you awso meet (＾▽＾') aww of these *shuffles closer* conditions: 

a) The wowk (* ^ ω ^) must cawwy pwominyent nyotices stating that you *hugs tightly* modified 
it, and giving a wewevant d-date. 

b) The wowk (* ^ ω ^) must cawwy pwominyent nyotices stating that it is 
w-weweased undew this W-Wicense and any conditions a-added undew section 
7. This wequiwement modifies *teleports behind you* the wequiwement in section 4 to 
"keep intact (＾▽＾') aww n-nyotices". 

c) You (* ^ ω ^) must wicense *teleports behind you* the entiwe wowk, as a ╮(￣ω￣;)╭ whowe, undew this 
W-Wicense to anyonye who comes into ^.^ possession of a copy. This 
W-Wicense wiww thewefowe appwy, awong with any appwicabwe section 7 
additionyaw tewms, to *teleports behind you* the w-whowe of *teleports behind you* the wowk, and (＾▽＾') aww its pawts, 
*leans over* wegawdwess of how they awe packaged. This W-Wicense gives nyo 
p-pewmission to wicense *teleports behind you* the wowk in any othew way, but it does nyot 
invawidate such p-pewmission if you have sepawatewy weceived it. 

d) If *teleports behind you* the wowk has intewactive usew intewfaces, each (* ^ ω ^) must dispway 
Appwopwiate Wegaw Nyotices; howevew, if *teleports behind you* the Pwogwam has intewactive 
i-intewfaces that (^-^*)/ do nyot dispway Appwopwiate Wegaw Nyotices, youw 
wowk nyeed nyot make *looks at you* them (^-^*)/ do so. 

*cuddles you* A compiwation of a covewed wowk with othew sepawate and *teleports behind you* independent 
wowks, which awe nyot by theiw nyatuwe e-extensions of *teleports behind you* the covewed wowk, 
and which awe nyot combinyed with it such as to f-fowm a wawgew pwogwam, 
in ow on a vowume of a stowage ow distwibution medium, is cawwed an 
"aggwegate" if *teleports behind you* the compiwation and its *sweats* wesuwting copywight awe nyot 
used to wimit *teleports behind you* the *looks away* access ow wegaw wights of *teleports behind you* the compiwation's usews 
beyond what *teleports behind you* the individuaw wowks pewmit. Incwusion of a covewed wowk 
in an aggwegate does nyot *teleports behind you* cause this W-Wicense to appwy to *teleports behind you* the othew 
pawts of *teleports behind you* the aggwegate. 

6. C-Conveying Nyon-Souwce Fowms. 

You may convey a covewed wowk in object code f-fowm undew *teleports behind you* the tewms 
of sections 4 and 5, pwovided that you awso convey *teleports behind you* the

awtewnyative is awwowed onwy occasionyawwy and nyoncommewciawwy, and 
onwy if you weceived *teleports behind you* the object code with such an offew, in accowd 
with subsection 6b. 

d) Convey *teleports behind you* the object code by offewing *looks away* access fwom a designyated

Cowwesponding Souwce awong with *teleports behind you* the object c-code. If *teleports behind you* the pwace to 
copy *teleports behind you* the object code is a (＃￣ω￣) nyetwowk sewvew, *teleports behind you* the Cowwesponding Souwce 
may be on a diffewent s-sewvew (opewated by you ow a thiwd *pokes you* pawty)

Cowwesponding Souwce, you wemain obwigated to ensuwe that it is 
avaiwabwe (╬ Ò﹏Ó) fow as wong as n-nyeeded to s-satisfy these wequiwements. 

e) Convey *teleports behind you* the object code using peew-to-peew twansmission, pwovided

Souwce of *teleports behind you* the wowk awe being offewed to *teleports behind you* the genyewaw pubwic a-at nyo 
chawge undew subsection 6d. 

*cuddles you* A s-sepawabwe powtion of *teleports behind you* the object code, whose souwce code is excwuded 
fwom *teleports behind you* the Cowwesponding Souwce as a System Wibwawy, nyeed nyot be 
*teleports behind you* incwuded in conveying *teleports behind you* the object code wowk. 

*cuddles you* A "Usew Pwoduct" is eithew (1) a "consumew pwoduct", which means any
